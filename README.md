# SampleGodotCSharpProject

A work-in-progress example Godot 4 project written in C# (with .Net 6.0), making use of the awesome utilities and game concepts from [@firebelley](https://github.com/firebelley)

## Purpose of this project

Develop game mechanics and patterns for Godot 4 using C#.
Try to make the development experience as satisfying and consistent as possible.

* Component based Scene Tree (Composition)
* Use of global signals (Game Events)
* Managers (Sound, Effects, Bonus) - subscribe to Game Events
* Godot Class extensions (add missing helper methods)

This project will also serve as a 'light' benchmark of the current `master` branch of Godot 4.

## How to build/run

Make sure you are using latest **Godot 4** version (I build **Godot 4** from source nearly every day and will try to keep this repo up-to-date accordingly).

I will try to keep the `GodotUtilities` folder from @firebelley in-sync with this project.

Look around, improve and feedback welcome.
